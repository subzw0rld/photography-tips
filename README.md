Focus Image should be placed on either of the red dots.

* Image should either be placed on the bottom 1/3 or the top 2/3 of the camera (**Tip** - Use the Grid feature of the camera)

* Focus image should never be centered on the camera and should be placed on either right or the left from the center.

* **Straighten the Horizon** - Use the balance bar (or the grid in case the camera does not have a balance bar) to make sure that the horizon is kept straight. A tilted photograph gives the user an unsettling feeling.

* Always make sure that the number of subjects are always odd as the eyes always focus on odd number of individuals.

* **Placement of Light** - A camera should never be facing the light source as it would result in dark and under exposed images. Make sure that the light source is always behind the camera.

* **Shadows** - Make sure that the shadows do not fall at odd points, the image should not contain your shadow. 

* **Background** - Background play a very crucial part as they give the images a sense of depth and helps them gain focus. Make sure that the bacground is always neutral and does not contain any pattern.

* **Perspective** - Always give your subject some perspective so that they don't stand out flat.

* Do not use the camera zoom of your phone as they use digital zoom which makes the images blurry.

* **Post-Processing** - Use software like Lightroom (preferably) or Photoshop to touch up your images.
